# Hello, World!

I wrote my own blog engine. I wanted to. The other that exist are just fine.

When using it locally, it watches the content and rebuilds it. The browser still
requires a manual refresh, but that's alright. It is developed using `ruby`.

All the posts are in the `posts` directory. They are all timestamped as
`YYYYMMDD.md`. The title used for navigation will always be single header `#`.

It can do fancy markdown things.

Source code rendering for `ruby`:

```ruby
puts "Hello, World"
```

<button>Custom Button with HTML</button>

## Smaller header

~~don't worry about it~~
